# Quantum-Algorithm
It's a list of the known Quantum Algorithm, which is the lite version of https://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/<br/>
And if there are some errors, please let me know.
We'll choose some algorithms which we're interested in and implement them on QuQ.
Thanks to https://math.nist.gov/quantum/zoo/ for their hard work.
