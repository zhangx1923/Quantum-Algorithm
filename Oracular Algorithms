  Grover's algorithm can find the target elements in a database containing N elements using O(\sqrt{N}) queries[1].
  Note that the solutions of many NP-complete problems can be accelerated by Grover searching.
  Amplitude estimation[2], which plays an important role in many quantum algorithms, is a generalization of Grover's algorithm.

  There is an oracle whose input is n bits and ouput is one bit. That is, we have 2^n possible inputs. DJ algorithm can use only one query
  to determine whether the oracle is balanced function or constant function[1], while the classical algorithm requires about O(2^(n-1)+1) queries.
  It's the first quantum algorithm achieving a speedup over classical computation.
